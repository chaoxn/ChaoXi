# TOMSMorphingLabel
Configurable morphing transitions between text values of a label.
Triggering the animation is as easy as setting the labels `text` property.

## Demo

## Installation with CocoaPods

TOMSMorphingLabel is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

#### Podfile

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'
pod "TOMSMorphingLabel", "~> 0.5"
```

## Usage

Instantiate TOMSMorphingLabel as you would do with an UILabel results in a fully working thus morphing label.

```objective-c
TOMSMorphingLabel *label = [[TOMSMorphingLabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 42, self.view.frame.size.width, 42)];
[self.view addSubview:label];
```

Setting - and particularly changing - the labels text property will automatically morph the labels previous text to the new value.

```objective-c
label.text = @"Swift";
```

Setting the labels text property using `setText:withCompletionBlock` will morph the labels as well as triggering the completion block when the animation is finished.

```objective-c
[label setText:@"Swift" withCompletionBlock:^{
  NSLog(@"label.text is now 'Swift'");
}];
```

Note that the label will execute only one morph transition at a time. If the text value of the label changes during a transition - even if it changes multiple times - the label will invoke a transition to the youngest text value that was set.

## Customization

TOMSMorphingLabel provides the possibility to configure the morphing transitions look and feel.
The configureable properties are defined as follows:

<table>
  <caption>configureable properties</caption>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>animationDuration: CGFloat</tt></td>
    <td>Time that elapses between the setting of a new text value and the end of the morphing transition. Default: 0.37</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>characterAnimationOffset: CGFloat</tt></td>
    <td>Spatial propagation speed of the character shrink and alpha effect. Default: 0.25</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>characterShrinkFactor: CGFloat</tt></td>
    <td>Factor that the scale of a completely disappeared character is divided by. Default: 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><tt>morphingEnabled: BOOL</tt></td>
    <td>Defines whether the morphing transition between text values is enabled. Default: YES</td>
  </tr>
</table>
